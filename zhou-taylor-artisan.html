            <section>
                <h2> Abstract </h2>
                <p> Dino tomic is a professional artist who was born in <b>Croatia</b> on Octover 9<sup>th</sup>, <em>1989</em>. However, he was brought up in Norway and earned his BA in the arts there. After graduating from college, he stayed in Norway and began his life as an artist. He specializes in hyperrealistic illustrations using various mixed media techniques including: </p>

                    <li> airbrushing </li>
                    <li> pencil </li>
                    <li> paint </li>
                    <li> digital </li>
                    <li> tattoos </li>
                </ul>
                <h2> Starting Artist </h2>
                <p> He began art school at 17 ears old and then started college for the art degree. As a beginning artist, he first learned that to achieve greatness you need to sacrifice a lot and needed to be built on "dedication and repeated failure". </p>
                <p> Building off of that, he began to set unrealistic challenges for himself. His first challenge was to draw, tattoo, airbrush, or paint a picture every day no matter what. It took years, but this challenge definitely pushed his boundaries. However, nothing was going to get in his way. When his wrist started hurting from drawing so much, he began to draw with his left hand. Finally, this habit built up and became a normal routine. He ended up feeling incredibly bad if he missed a single day. </p>
                <p> Finally at the age of 26 in the year 2016, he has finally achieved all his goals. He'd become a great artist at a young age, became infamous with online followers on some of the biggest social networks known on the Internet including Facebook and Instagram, was and is still sponsored by one of the biggest pencil producers, Derwent, and had an <a href="http://www.lovepencils.co.uk/post/2014/02/24/Interview-Dino-Tomic.aspx"> interview</a> on TV before about his greatest artwork. </p>

                <h2> Inspiration </h2>
                <p> So where did Dino get his source of inspiration from? Where does he find his motivation? Well like most artists, he has a huge list of other artists which he aspires from so his inspiration is not derived from one, but many artists. Ultimately, however, it is the knowledge that other artists work just as hard as he did to master their own craft through grueling years of tears and failures that drives him to success. </p>
                <p> In one of his interviews with Dervent's <em>lovepencils</em> blog, he was asked to give some advice to starting artists. Here's what he said. </p>
                <blockquote> "Don't give up. And practice. Set yourself a goal and don't get distracted. Use YouTube, there is more than enough good videos out there that you can learn everything you need to know." </blockquote>
